# TechHub 

TechHub is a sample educational app that provides courses for people who want to learn new skills in tech-related areas. 

The goal of this project is to practice & demonstrate the use of some Modern Android Development Practices,
Material Design Theming & Android Animations.

## ðŸ•¹ Animations ðŸ•¹

This app uses shared element container transforms to create a 
visible connection between two UI elements and represent
parent-child relationship between fragment transitions.

## ðŸ›  Architecture ðŸ› 

The application complies with the following recommended best practices for building robust, high-quality apps.

* **Single Activity Architecture**: One single activity and several fragments.
* **MVVM**: MVVM based architecture, using a local database   as a Single Source of Truth.
* **Android Architecture Components**:  libraries part of Android Jetpack to give a robust design, testable and maintainable to modern applications.

## ðŸ¦¾ Tech Stack ðŸ¦¾

This project takes advantage many popular libraries and tools in the Android ecosystem:

* **ROOM**: Persistence Library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLLite to allow for a more robust database access.
* **Lifecycle**: Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component.
* **ViewModel**: Designed to manage and store UI related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* **LiveData**: A lifecycle-aware observable data holder class, that respects the lifecycle of other app components.
* **Navigation**: Implement navigation and transactions between fragments.
* **Kotlin Coroutines**: Managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
* **Kotlin Flow**: Cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values 
* **Kotlin Serialization**: Converts data used by an application to a format that can be transferred over a network or stored in a database or a file. 
* **Dagger Hilt**: A fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android.
* **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client.
* **Glide**: An image loading library.
* **ViewBinding**: Allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* **Material 3**: The latest version of Material Design, introduced in Android 12.
* **Material Motion**: A set of transition patterns that can help users understand and navigate an app.
